footbawwl
=========

Some serious footbawwl in here.

A web server for hosting a fantasy American Football competition. Allows creation of users with a team name, selection of players and automated updates of player stats and scores.

Installation
============

You will need [rails](http://rubyonrails.org/download) before you can do anything. Once you have done that:

- Clone the repository:

```git clone git://github.com/ishakir/footbawwl```

- Change into the directory created:

```cd footbawwl```

- And start the rails server

```rails server```

Note to self for now, likely to take more than just this, but we'll confirm that later when we try to set it up!

Contributing
============

If you're interested in contributing please get in contact with ishakir or powdermike, we're putting this together in our spare time, so any help would be most welcome!
